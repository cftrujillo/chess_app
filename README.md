# Chesster (Colligate Chess Application)

## To Launch
* First, you need an IDE to download the code from this repository. I used IntelliJ so I recommend you download that IDE as well.
1. Go to the [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/edu-products/download/other-IIE.html) community edition download page and download the latest version for your system (Mine is Windows for example):
![inteliJ tutorial](https://github.com/cftrujillo/chess_app/assets/99206212/38b9d9d6-9b04-4f57-a2c0-955588950412)
2. Go through the installation process and when done launch, and you will be brought to this page:
![intelliJ_home_page](https://github.com/cftrujillo/chess_app/assets/99206212/9c89a14c-116e-4179-b37f-e78973d1aa78)
3. Now, return to this GitHub repo and go to the 'Code' tab at the top of the page.
4. Click on the green 'Code' button and copy the repo link:
![vcs_link](https://github.com/cftrujillo/chess_app/assets/99206212/4232e395-e839-4bcc-8f30-b3fcd8a4420f)
5. Return to IntelliJ and click on 'Get from VCS' tab on the top of the home screen.
6. Copy the link into the 'URL' field and pick a directory on your computer which you want to store the project:

7. Click 'Clone' button in the bottom right and wait for the IDE to load the project.
8. Once loaded, make sure you have the current version of the JDK installed (IntelliJ should prompt you with an installation in the bottom right once you load the project).
9. After JDK is up to date, click on the 'Run Main' green arrow at the top of the IDE:

11. After that, you should have a window launched with the chess engine and are ready to play!:
