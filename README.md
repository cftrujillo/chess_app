# Chesster (Colligate Chess Application)

## To Launch
* First, you need an IDE to download the code from this repository. I used IntelliJ so I recommend you download that IDE as well.
1. Go to the [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/edu-products/download/other-IIE.html) community edition download page and download the latest version for your system (Mine is Windows for example).
